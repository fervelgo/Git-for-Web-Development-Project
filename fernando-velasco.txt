    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.

    First. You go to GitHub, to the repo you want to work on. Top right, clone button. Copy that URL.
    Then, in your Terminal, follow these steps:
    Navigate to de dir you want to save the repo to (cd directoryABC)
    Once there: git clone [paste the URL you copied from GitHub] ----> This will make a local copy of the main repo, a copy in your computer.
    Navigate to the file you just cloned (cd Clonicius)
    Once there: git checkout -b Clonicius ---> This will create a branch of the main repo you just cloned. This is still only happening in your computer.
    Open the branch in your code editor. From the Terminal (code .) or from the GUI of your OS.
    Edit away.
    Once you're done and your work is saved in VSCode: 
    git add .
    git commit -m "your helpful message"
    git push -u origin "branchName"
    After this you can go to GitHub and from the menu of the repo click on Compare and Pull Request. Making sure the "compare:" repo shown is YOUR repo, not Lambda Schools.
    Send pull request and done.            
     


Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    a block element takes the whole width of the page, has margins above and below, and starts a new line. It's quite literally a block. Inline elements take width necessary for the content. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    They are removed from the flow of the elements on the page. It's position will not be affected by the position of other elements.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    Flexbox might be a way. Also to use margin and/or padding properties to define the width. 
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block:
        1. div
        2. li
        3. footer
    inline:
        1. span
        2. input
    inline-block:
        1.img
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    It's a way to give "spacial" sense to the elements on the page. the fix is to use relative positioning. Also, use flexbox.
